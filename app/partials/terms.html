<h4>4. Product & Services </h4>

GAC will engage service partners, referred to herein as Agents, to perform all or any part or parts of the Service.
The Service will normally begin when the Agent’s representative meets you and will normally end when Agent leaves you.
A Departure, Arrival and a Transit service entitles to a maximum time of 3 Hours. Any time after that may incur further charges.
Although Airport concierge service is a VIP Meet and Assist service, we without any additional charges do provide Fast Track wherever available and allowed by the relevant Authorities. 
Airside access at some airports may be subject to possible security restrictions, we will advise at time of booking if this does occur.

<h4>5. Pricing & Inclusions/Exclusions</h4>

Prices are based on the tariff at the time of quoting, and are converted into the displayed currency at the prevailing foreign-exchange rate as determined by GAC. All prices are inclusive of all Airport, local and service taxes.
Price quotations and price tables may change without notice up until seven days before the service start time. If a material amendment to an order or Booked Service is requested by the traveller or booker and is accepted by GAC then the amended price will use the exchange rates and tariffs subsisting at the time of change and additional charges may be payable.
The base price quoted at the time of ordering will include all knowable charges for the Service that has been ordered. Prices do not include foreign departure tax, Immigration clearance charges i.e. Visa fee, security, port charges, customs, immigration, agricultural, passenger-facility charges or international transportation tax.

GAC reserves the right to invalidate your discount or special-offer pricing if you make any change to the service you have ordered.

<h4>6. Payment</h4>

No contract between you and GAC will come into existence until the order becomes a Confirmed booking. A service is confirmed (a “Confirmed Service”) once
a. GAC has issued a booking reference number; and 
b. GAC has issued an booking confirmation; and 
c. GAC has received payment in full;
In the same way that you may cancel and receive a full refund up to 48 Hours from time of service before the service Meeting time, GAC may amend the price quoted or billed if the subsisting selling price changes, due to underlying cost changes, exchange rate movements, system error or human error. In the event that the revised price quote is not acceptable to you a full refund will immediately be made. GAC will not change the price of a Booked Service, as defined above. 
Payment by credit card is required to make a reservation. Payment will be listed as Global Airport Concierge Limited on the credit card statement.
There is a charge or service fee of 3.5% for processing card payments. 
The amount charged by GAC will be the amount due in the currency used for the booking, which is in US dollars, pounds sterling or euros, as you select at the time of booking. GAC cannot know or influence the exchange rate and policies that are applied by your bank or card merchant in determining the final charge made. 
GAC may take whatever steps it reasonably believe to be necessary (i) to protect your card details (which will be in GAC ’s possession) from misuse; and/or (ii) to protect itself and its Agent from any delay in receiving payment for a completed Service. Such steps may include pre-authorising the charge and verifying the card details and the card’s available credit limit.
A chargeback is when you dispute a charge made on your card. If you make an unjustified charge back, GAC will charge a US$75 penalty fee and will report all unjustified chargebacks to ChargeBackProtection.org, which may have the effect of banning you from placing orders with any business that uses ChargeBackProtection.org. Examples of unjustified chargebacks are (i) if you issue a frivolous, false or unjustified complaint, (ii) if you start an unwarranted dispute with your card company, (iii) if you refuse to pay for a properly delivered Service and any charges thereto, (iv) if you refuse to pay properly due late booking Fee, amendment, cancellation or no-show charges.
Refunds will be made provided that you have paid in full and that the booking is eligible for refund. For a booking originally paid for by credit/charge card, any refund will automatically process to the original credit/charge card account that paid for the booking and no other methods of refund payment will be possible.

<h4>7. Cancellation, amendments and variations</h4>

GAC is a fixed price service and the price charged is for the Confirmed Service.
If the Confirmed Service is amended, cancelled before the Meeting time, or is varied during its performance (a “Change”) then GAC and its Agents may require payment of additional fees.
Any charge incurred due to a Change before the Meeting time will be billed and collected by GAC from the nominated credit/charge card.
GAC may be able to accept amendments within 48 hours before a scheduled Meeting time, however it will incur additional charge. If,an amendment is required more than 48 hours before the Meeting time a Service can be materially amended, or be materially reduced in value, or materially delayed by the Passenger, subject to a Change fee to the Cardholders card by the GAC as follows
• if the Change is accepted more than 48 hours before the meeting time no Change fee will apply
• Within 48 Hours, amendments will incur 50% charge.
If the Booked Service is cancelled before the Meeting time a refund will be available as follows:
• if the Cancellation is made more than 48 hours before the Meeting Time a 100% refund will apply
• if the Cancellation is made within 48 hours of the Meeting Time no refund will be applicable
No Shows or Service declined for whatever reason will be charged at 100% of the job value
Proof of Amendment: Voluntary Amendments or cancellation will only be deemed as accepted when a confirmation e-mail acceptance is sent by GAC to the requested e-mail address.
Insurance: We strongly recommend that you purchase a comprehensive Travel Insurance Policy prior to departure covering charges you will incur in the event of delays or changes to flights, changes in airport conditions, and lost or damaged baggage.
